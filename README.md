Minishell is a small-scale recreation of bash that helps us understand how a real shell works. It handles user input, executes commands, manages pipes and redirections, and deals with environment variables.

It was a team project with ilmahjou. I worked on the execution part and the integration of the code. 
I used a matrix*** instead of lists because I wanted to challenge myself, even if it wasn’t the most efficient option.

The project was completed after about three months of work. It was a great experience in teamwork, debugging, and system-level programming.
